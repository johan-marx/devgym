Hey guys,
As this was a deployment week, I hope this is a fun and lighthearted exercise to give you some more exposure to various web technologies.

We will be using npm, Vite, and Three.js to create a 3D-rendered scene.

Tasks
1. Create a new npm project
2. Install Three.js and Vite using https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Installation
3. Create a basic scene by following https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene
4. Replace the spinning square with this custom model https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bn7c0jwiEEgcUraWS-9tI94S09IiVV4z/view?usp=sharing . Some help can be found here: https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Loading-3D-models
5. Add some lights to see your model and play around with the `animate` function to customize your scene
6. Add some custom functionality for holding the spacebar. For example, change light intensity/colour while the spacebar is held down
